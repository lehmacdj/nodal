We have several means of interacting with the main controller:
- Touch
- Two finger touch
- Three finger touch
- Pencil Touch
- Zooming

By default two and three finger touch will be bound to meta interactions,
i.e. scrolling the global view, or an object that we are enclosed inside of.
Probably:
- Two finger -> scroll the global view, without changing anything
- Three finger -> move the immediately enclosing object

We need the following ways of interacting with documents:
- Zooming
- Scrolling
- Moving objects
- Drawing
- Inserting text
- etc.
